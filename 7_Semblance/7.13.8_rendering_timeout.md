From the logs, it seems like the main issues are related to the remote rendering service timing out and authentication failures. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot these issues:

### Remote Rendering Service Timeout

1. **Check Service Availability**:
   - Ensure that the remote rendering service is running and accessible. You can try accessing the service directly from the Grafana pod using `curl` or `wget` to see if it responds.



2. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Verify that there are no network issues preventing Grafana from reaching the rendering service. Check firewall rules and network policies that might be blocking the connection.

3. **Increase Timeout Settings**:
   - You can increase the timeout settings for the rendering service in the Grafana configuration. This can help if the service is slow to respond. Update the `GF_RENDERING_HTTP_SERVER_URL` and `GF_RENDERING_CALLBACK_URL` environment variables if needed[1](https://community.grafana.com/t/failed-to-send-request-to-remote-rendering-service/31600).

### Authentication Failures

1. **Token Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the authentication tokens are correctly configured and not expired. Check the token settings in your Grafana configuration and update them if necessary.

2. **Review Authentication Logs**:
   - Look into the authentication service logs for more details on why the tokens are not being found. This can provide more context on the failures.

### Example Commands

To check the remote rendering service from within the Grafana pod, you can use:

```sh
kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- curl http://grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8081/render/version
```


@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-automation (main) $ kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- curl http://grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8081/render/version
Defaulted container "grafana" out of: grafana, init-chmod-data (init)


To increase the timeout settings, you can add or update the following in your Grafana configuration file (`grafana.ini`):

```ini
[rendering]
server_url = http://grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8081/render
callback_url = http://your-grafana-url
concurrent_render_request_limit = 5
```

----


It looks like the command executed successfully, but there's no output indicating the response from the remote rendering service. This could mean that the service is not responding or there might be an issue with the service itself.

### Next Steps

1. **Check Service Logs**:
   - Look at the logs of the `grafana-imagerenderer` service to see if there are any errors or issues. You can use the following command to get the logs:

     ```sh
     kubectl logs -n grafana-monitoring <imagerenderer-pod-name>
     ```

     @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-automation (main) $ kubectl get pods -n grafana-monitoring
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q                 1/1     Running   0          21m
grafana-imagerenderer-7f4d94857d-8rl9w   1/1     Running   0          21m
grafana-imagerenderer-7f4d94857d-w78wz   1/1     Running   0          21m

 kubectl logs -n grafana-monitoring grafana-imagerenderer-7f4d94857d-8rl9w
 @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-automation (main) $ kubectl logs -n grafana-monitoring grafana-imagerenderer-7f4d94857d-8rl9w
{"level":"info","message":"HTTP Server started, listening at http://localhost:8081"}
@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-automation (main) $ 


kubectl logs -n grafana-monitoring grafana-imagerenderer-7f4d94857d-w78wz


2. **Verify Service Status**:
   - Ensure that the `grafana-imagerenderer` service is running and healthy. You can check the status of the pods in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace:

     ```sh
     kubectl get pods -n grafana-monitoring
     ```

3. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Test the network connectivity from the Grafana pod to the rendering service. You can use `ping` or `telnet` to check if the service is reachable:

     ```sh
     kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- ping grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local
     ```

4. **Configuration Review**:
   - Double-check the Grafana configuration to ensure that the remote rendering service URL is correctly set.

Would you like help with any specific step or further troubleshooting?

The logs indicate that the `grafana-imagerenderer` service has started successfully and is listening on `http://localhost:8081`. This suggests that the service itself is running correctly.

### Next Steps

1. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure that the Grafana pod can reach the `grafana-imagerenderer` service. You can use `ping` or `telnet` to test connectivity:

     ```sh
     kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- ping grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local
     ```

2. **Verify Service URL Configuration**:
   - Double-check the Grafana configuration to ensure that the remote rendering service URL is correctly set. The URL should match the service address and port.

3. **Increase Timeout Settings**:
   - If the service is slow to respond, consider increasing the timeout settings in the Grafana configuration. This can help if there are intermittent network issues.

4. **Check for Firewall Rules**:
   - Ensure that there are no firewall rules or network policies blocking the connection between Grafana and the rendering service.

It looks like the `ping` command is not available in the Grafana container. Let's try using `curl` or `wget` instead to test the connectivity to the `grafana-imagerenderer` service.

### Using `curl` to Test Connectivity

You can use the following command to check if the Grafana pod can reach the rendering service:

```sh
kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- curl -I http://grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8081/render/version
```

This command will attempt to fetch the headers from the rendering service URL. If the service is reachable, you should see a response with HTTP headers.

### Using `wget` to Test Connectivity

If `curl` is not available, you can try `wget`:

```sh
kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- wget -qO- http://grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8081/render/version
```

This command will attempt to fetch the content from the rendering service URL.

### Next Steps

1. **Run the above commands** to test connectivity.
2. **Check the output** to see if the service is reachable.
3. **Share the results** if you encounter any issues, and we can troubleshoot further.

Would you like to proceed with these steps or need help with something else?

It seems like both `ping` and `wget` are not available in the Grafana container. Let's try using `curl` again, but first, we need to ensure that `curl` is installed in the container.

### Checking for `curl` Installation

1. **Check if `curl` is installed**:
   - Execute the following command to see if `curl` is available:

     ```sh
     kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- curl --version
     ```

2. **Install `curl` if not available**:
   - If `curl` is not installed, you might need to install it. However, installing packages in a running container can be tricky and is not always recommended. Instead, you might want to update the Docker image to include `curl`.

### Using `kubectl exec` with `curl`

If `curl` is available, you can use it to test the connectivity:

```sh
kubectl exec -n grafana-monitoring -it grafana-567b65cdf7-s469q -- curl -I http://grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8081/render/version
```

### Alternative Approach

If modifying the container is not an option, you can also:

1. **Create a temporary pod** with `curl` installed to test the connectivity:

   ```sh
   kubectl run curlpod --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty --rm
   ```

2. **Test the connectivity** from the temporary pod:

   ```sh
   curl -I http://grafana-imagerenderer.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8081/render/version
   ```

Would you like to proceed with checking for `curl` in the Grafana container or creating a temporary pod for testing?
