It looks like there's an issue with resolving the host `grafana`. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check DNS Configuration**: Ensure that the DNS configuration in your Kubernetes cluster is correct. You can check the CoreDNS logs for any errors.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
    ```


It looks like the DNS queries are failing to resolve the `grafana` service within your cluster. Here are a few steps to help troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check Service Name and Namespace**: Ensure that the service name and namespace are correct. The service should be accessible using the full DNS name `grafana.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local`.

2. **Verify Service and Endpoints**: Confirm that the Grafana service and endpoints are correctly set up and running.

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
    kubectl get endpoints -n grafana-monitoring
    ```

3. **Update Curl Command**: Use the full DNS name in your curl command to ensure it resolves correctly.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer glsa_lxij29TuRsb1cp97uaiRI4tCqAoHz5an_c1d82a79" \
      "http://grafana.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:3000/render/d-solo/be6uebcjc1mgwe/1?orgId=1&from=2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&to=2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z&width=1000&height=500" \
      --output dashboard.png
    ```

4. **Check CoreDNS Configuration**: Ensure that CoreDNS is correctly configured and running. You can check the CoreDNS logs for any errors.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
    ```

5. **Network Policies**: If you have network policies in place, ensure they allow traffic between your pods and the Grafana service.

6. **Restart Pods**: Sometimes restarting the pods can resolve transient issues.

    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart deployment grafana -n grafana-monitoring
    ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the DNS resolution issue. Let me know if you need any further assistance! ðŸ˜Š


2. **Verify Service and Endpoints**: Make sure the Grafana service and endpoints are correctly set up and running.

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
    kubectl get endpoints -n grafana-monitoring
    ```

3. **Check Network Policies**: If you have network policies in place, ensure they allow traffic between your pods and the Grafana service.

4. **Use Full Service Name**: Sometimes using the full service name including the namespace can help. Try updating your curl command to:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer glsa_lxij29TuRsb1cp97uaiRI4tCqAoHz5an_c1d82a79" \
      "http://grafana.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:3000/render/d-solo/be6uebcjc1mgwe/1?orgId=1&from=2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&to=2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z&width=1000&height=500" \
      --output dashboard.png
    ```

5. **Check Pod Logs**: Look at the logs of the Grafana pod to see if there are any errors or warnings.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n grafana-monitoring <grafana-pod-name>
    ```

6. **Restart Pods**: Sometimes simply restarting the pods can resolve transient issues.

    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart deployment grafana -n grafana-monitoring
    ```

Try these steps and see if they resolve the issue. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š

It seems like the DNS resolution issue persists. Here are a few more steps you can try to resolve this:

1. **Check CoreDNS ConfigMap**: Ensure that the CoreDNS configuration is correct. You can check the CoreDNS ConfigMap for any misconfigurations.

    ```bash
    kubectl get configmap coredns -n kube-system -o yaml
    ```

2. **Restart CoreDNS Pods**: Sometimes restarting the CoreDNS pods can help resolve DNS issues.

    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart deployment coredns -n kube-system
    ```

3. **Check Network Policies**: Verify that there are no network policies blocking DNS traffic.

4. **Use a Different Namespace**: If possible, try deploying Grafana in a different namespace to see if the issue persists.

5. **Add DNS Entry Manually**: As a temporary workaround, you can add a DNS entry manually in the `/etc/hosts` file of the pod where you are running the curl command. This is not a permanent solution but can help in debugging.

    ```bash
    echo "10.244.0.7 grafana.grafana-monitoring.svc.cluster.local" >> /etc/hosts
    ```

6. **Check Service and Endpoints Again**: Double-check that the service and endpoints are correctly set up and running.

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
    kubectl get endpoints -n grafana-monitoring
    ```

7. **Use Ingress**: If you have an Ingress controller set up, you can create an Ingress resource for Grafana and use the Ingress URL in your curl command.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: grafana-ingress
      namespace: grafana-monitoring
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: grafana.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: grafana
                port:
                  number: 3000
    ```

    Then update your curl command to use `http://grafana.example.com`.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the DNS resolution issue. Let me know if you need any further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
