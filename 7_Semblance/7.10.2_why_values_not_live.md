It looks like there might be a few potential issues with your Helm chart configuration for Grafana and the Grafana Image Renderer. Here are some common problems and suggestions to troubleshoot:

1. **Service Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the `nodePort` values for both Grafana and the Grafana Renderer do not conflict with other services in your cluster. Both are set to `NodePort`, which might cause issues if the ports are already in use.

2. **Volume Permissions**:
   - The `initContainers` are set to change permissions on the `/var/lib/grafana` directory. Ensure that this directory is correctly mounted and that the `chmod` command is executed successfully. You might want to check the logs of the `initContainers` to verify this.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Verify that the environment variables for rendering are correctly set and that the Grafana Renderer service is accessible at the specified URLs. Ensure that the `GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL` and `GF_RENDERING_CALLBACK_URL` are reachable from the Grafana pod.

4. **Persistence Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the persistence settings are correctly applied and that the volume is properly mounted. Check if the `grafana-storage` volume is correctly created and mounted.

5. **Plugin Installation**:
   - The `grafana-image-renderer` plugin should be installed correctly. Verify that the plugin is listed in the Grafana plugins directory and that there are no errors during its installation.

6. **Helm Chart Values**:
   - Double-check the values you are passing to the Helm chart. Ensure that there are no typos or incorrect values that might cause the deployment to fail.

7. **Logs and Debugging**:
   - Check the logs of the Grafana and Grafana Renderer pods for any errors or warnings that might indicate what went wrong. Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to view the logs.

If these suggestions don't resolve the issue, you might want to refer to the Bitnami Grafana Helm chart documentation for more detailed information and troubleshooting steps[1](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/2519)[2](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/10050).
