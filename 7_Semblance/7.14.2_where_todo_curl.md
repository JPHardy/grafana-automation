🚀 I am using GitHub Codespaces  
💻 I use the terminal there to send `kubectl` commands  
🔧 I have a Minikube running in Codespaces  
🌐 I want to send a `curl` command to my Grafana which runs inside the Minikube  
🔄 My services are running with port forwarding which lets me browse the services  
❓ How do I get the URL to do the `curl` to my Grafana service?  

Got it! Let's get you the URL for your Grafana service. Since you're using port forwarding with Minikube, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the port forwarding details**: Run the following command to see the port forwarding details for your Grafana service:
   ```sh
   kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
   ```
   Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where Grafana is running. This will list all services and their port forwarding details.

@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-automation (main) $ kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
NAME                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
grafana                 ClusterIP   10.103.174.110   <none>        3000/TCP   48m
grafana-imagerenderer   ClusterIP   10.101.81.231    <none>        3000/TCP   48m
@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-automation (main) $ 

2. **Identify the Grafana service**: Look for the Grafana service in the output. Note the `PORT(S)` column, which shows the port mappings.

grafana                 ClusterIP   10.103.174.110   <none>        3000/TCP   48m

3. **Get the Minikube IP**: Run the following command to get the Minikube IP:
   ```sh
   minikube ip
   ```
@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/grafana-automation (main) $  minikube ip
192.168.49.2

4. **Construct the URL**: Combine the Minikube IP with the port number for Grafana. For example, if the Minikube IP is `192.168.49.2` and the Grafana service is mapped to port `3000`, the URL would be:
   ```sh
   http://192.168.49.2:3000
   ```


5. **Send the `curl` command**: Now you can use `curl` to interact with Grafana:
   ```sh
   curl http://192.168.49.2:3000
   ```
It looks like you've already got the steps down! Just to recap and ensure everything is clear:

1. **Check the port forwarding details**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
   ```
   This command lists all services in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace, including their port forwarding details.

2. **Identify the Grafana service**:
   From your output:
   ```
   grafana                 ClusterIP   10.103.174.110   <none>        3000/TCP   48m
   ```
   The Grafana service is running on port `3000`.

3. **Get the Minikube IP**:
   ```sh
   minikube ip
   ```
   Your Minikube IP is `192.168.49.2`.

4. **Construct the URL**:
   Combine the Minikube IP with the Grafana port:
   ```sh
   http://192.168.49.2:3000
   ```

5. **Send the `curl` command**:
   ```sh
   curl http://192.168.49.2:3000
   ```

This should allow you to interact with your Grafana service using `curl`. If you run into any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask! 🚀
