# ðŸš€ Grafana Dashboard Automation Setup
Sure, let's focus on the setup part of your Grafana Dashboard Automation Project:

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
1. ðŸš§ Set up Grafana monitoring environment
2. ðŸ”„ Configure basic JSON data collection and visualization
3. ðŸš€ Implement dashboard automation with screenshot capabilities

## ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Grafana Setup
### ðŸš§ Current State
- ðŸš§ Daily status reports take 60 minutes to create
- These are defined diagrams placed into a PDF report

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps
1. **Establish Grafana in a Containerized Environment**
   - Use Docker or Kubernetes to deploy Grafana.
   - Ensure the environment is isolated and easily manageable.

2. **Implement a Configuration Management Approach**
   - Use tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to manage configurations.
   - Ensure configurations are version-controlled.

3. **Define a Persistent Storage Strategy**
   - Use persistent volumes in Kubernetes or bind mounts in Docker.
   - Ensure data is not lost when containers are restarted.

4. **Install Grafana Using Bitnami Helm Charts**
   - Use Helm to simplify the deployment process.
   - Run the following command to install Grafana:
     ```bash
     helm install grafana bitnami/grafana
     ```

5. **Configure Initial Admin Access**
   - Set up admin credentials during the installation.
   - Ensure secure access by configuring strong passwords and enabling HTTPS.

6. **Verify Connectivity and Basic Functionality**
   - Access the Grafana UI to ensure it is running.
   - Check logs for any errors and resolve them.

7. **Commit Updates to Version Control for Configurations**
   - Use Git or another version control system to track changes.
   - Ensure all configuration files are committed and documented.

## ðŸ”„ Technical Dependencies
1. **Minikube**
   - Use Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster setup.
   - Ensure it is properly configured and running.

2. **Latest Version of Grafana**
   - Always use the latest stable release of Grafana.
   - Check the official Grafana website for updates.

3. **JSON Data Source**
   - Configure JSON as the primary data source for Grafana.
   - Ensure data is correctly formatted and accessible.

4. **Screenshot Automation Command**
   - Use tools like `grafana-image-renderer` or `curl` for screenshot automation.
   - Ensure the tools are installed and configured.

5. **Version Control System**
   - Use Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
   - Ensure all team members have access and understand the workflow.

## ðŸ”„ Success Criteria
- [ ] Grafana successfully deployed and accessible
- [ ] Initial admin access configured
- [ ] Basic functionality verified
- [ ] Configuration updates committed to version control

## ðŸ”„ Risk Mitigation
1. **Data Persistence Strategy**
   - Ensure persistent storage is correctly configured to avoid data loss.

2. **Backup Procedures**
   - Implement regular backups of Grafana configurations and data.

3. **Access Control and Security**
   - Configure secure access controls and monitor for unauthorized access.

4. **Resource Utilization Monitoring**
   - Monitor resource usage to ensure the environment is not overburdened.

5. **Error Handling Procedures**
   - Set up alerts and logs to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## ðŸ”„ Documentation Requirements
1. **Setup Instructions**
   - Provide detailed steps for setting up Grafana.

2. **Configuration Guide**
   - Document all configuration settings and their purposes.

3. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Include common issues and their resolutions.

This setup-focused structure should help you get Grafana up and running efficiently. If you need further details or assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
