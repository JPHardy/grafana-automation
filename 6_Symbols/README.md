## 📝 Objective

### Self-Learning Method Using Lacan's Triad

1. **Real**: The actual coding and implementation work.
   - *Example*: Writing and running code snippets in the Symbols Code folder.

2. **Symbolic**: The code itself, which acts as a system of symbols.
   - *Example*: The structure and syntax of the code in the Symbols Code folder.

3. **Imaginary**: The conceptual understanding and envisioned outcomes.
   - *Example*: Visualizing the final working implementation of a code pattern.

### Methodology to Learn and Update Skills

- **Identify Learning Goals**: Determine what you need to learn to improve your coding skills.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Regularly write and execute code, focusing on different patterns and concepts.
- **Reflect and Document**: Keep a log of your progress, noting challenges and solutions.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Continuously refine your code based on feedback and new knowledge.

## 🎓 Key Results

- **Document Learning Progress**: Maintain detailed notes on each coding exercise.
- **Track Skill Improvements**: Use metrics such as code efficiency, error rates, and execution time.
- **Validate Understanding**: Ensure that the code works as intended through testing and validation.
- **Identify Knowledge Gaps**: Regularly review your progress and identify areas where further learning is needed.
