### **Minikube Environment 🐳✨**
Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes (K8s) setup 🌐, perfect for development and testing locally. It creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine on your computer. Here's what you can expect:
- **Cluster Management**: Helps you deploy applications quickly 🏗️.
- **Local Development**: A fantastic playground for trying out Kubernetes features without cloud costs! 🏞️.

### **Grafana for Monitoring 📊👁️**
Grafana is your go-to tool for **data visualization** and monitoring. In this setup:
- **Dashboards Galore**: Create visual dashboards to monitor metrics 📉🔍.
- **Data Sources**: Integrate with Prometheus, JSON servers, or other databases seamlessly 🔗.
- **Alerts**: Configure alerts to keep you informed about your system’s state ⏰.

### **JSON Server + Flask Project 🐍📦**
This combo is perfect for building lightweight APIs:
1. **JSON Server**: Acts as a quick mock server to simulate APIs 🛠️. Useful for front-end or testing scenarios.
2. **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework 🐍. Ideal for creating REST APIs or microservices.

Example Use Case:
- **JSON Server** provides a mock API with static JSON data 🗂️.
- **Flask** adds more dynamic or custom logic to enhance the mock API 🚀.

---

### **Curl Environment 🌐⚡**
Curl is the Swiss Army knife 🛠️ for testing APIs from the terminal:
- Send HTTP requests to interact with your Flask APIs or JSON server 🌐.
- Debug network issues or test API responses in real time 🕵️.

### **How It Comes Together 🧩**
1. **Minikube** hosts your Grafana dashboards and maybe Flask app if you're containerizing 🏗️.
2. Use **Grafana** to monitor your Minikube cluster and app metrics 📊.
3. Mock APIs with **JSON Server**, extend functionality with **Flask**, and test it all with **Curl** 🕵️.
4. Minikube and Grafana give a Kubernetes-native monitoring and API-hosting environment 🌟.

### **Getting Started with Minikube 🚀**
Here are the essential commands to get your Minikube environment up and running:
```bash
# Start Minikube
minikube start

# Check Minikube status
