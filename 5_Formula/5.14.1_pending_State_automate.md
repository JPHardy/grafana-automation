It looks like the Grafana pod is in a Pending state, which means it hasn't started running yet. This can happen for various reasons, such as insufficient resources or scheduling constraints. Hereâ€™s a script to wait for the pod to be in a Running state before attempting to port-forward:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to wait for the pod to be running
wait_for_pod() {
  namespace=$1
  pod_name=$2

  while true; do
    status=$(kubectl get pod -n $namespace $pod_name -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}')
    if [ "$status" == "Running" ]; then
      echo "Pod $pod_name is running."
      break
    else
      echo "Waiting for pod $pod_name to be running. Current status=$status"
      sleep 5
    fi
  done
}

# Namespace and pod name
NAMESPACE="grafana-monitoring"
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

# Wait for the Grafana pod to be running
wait_for_pod $NAMESPACE $POD_NAME

# Port-forward once the pod is running
kubectl port-forward -n $NAMESPACE svc/grafana 3000:3000
```

This script will:
1. **Wait for the Grafana pod to be in the Running state** by checking its status every 5 seconds.
2. **Port-forward** to the Grafana service once the pod is running.

You can save this script to a file, make it executable, and run it. This should help automate the process and avoid manual retries. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
