To add a draw.io (diagrams.net) diagram to your Git project and ensure it can be updated, follow these steps:

1. **Create or Open a Diagram**:
   - Go to draw.io and create a new diagram or open an existing one.

2. **Save to GitHub**:
   - Click on **File** > **Save As** > **GitHub**.
   - Authorize draw.io to access your GitHub account if prompted.
   - Select the repository where you want to save the diagram.
   - Choose the branch and directory, then enter a file name and commit message.

3. **Edit and Update**:
   - To update the diagram, open it from your GitHub repository in draw.io.
   - Make your changes and save them directly back to the repository with a new commit message.

4. **Embed in Markdown**:
   - You can embed the diagram in your project's README or other markdown files using a relative link:
     ```markdown
     !Diagram
     ```
   - This ensures the diagram is version-controlled and updates are reflected in your documentation.

5. **Use VS Code Extension**:
   - Alternatively, you can use the Draw.io Visual Studio Code extension to edit diagrams directly within VS Code. This method allows you to work offline and commit changes to your Git repository seamlessly[1](https://gist.github.com/philip-gai/9c801bdff0ec4c1954f18217dc808476).

By following these steps, you can maintain and update your draw.io diagrams within your Git project efficiently. If you need more detailed guidance, feel free to ask!
