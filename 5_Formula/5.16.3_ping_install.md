It looks like the `ping` command isn't available in your current environment. This could be due to the `ping` utility not being installed or not being in your system's PATH.

You can try installing it using the package manager for your operating system. For example, on a Debian-based system like Ubuntu, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install iputils-ping
```
It seems like the `iputils-ping` package isn't available in your current repository. Here are a few alternatives you can try:

1. **Install `ping` using a different package name**:
   - On some systems, the package might be named `iputils` instead of `iputils-ping`. Try:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install iputils
     ```

2. **Use `Test-NetConnection`**:
   - If you're on a Windows system, you can use `Test-NetConnection` as an alternative to `ping`:
     ```powershell
     Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.49.2
     ```

3. **Alternative tools**:
   - There are several other tools that can perform similar functions to `ping`. Some of these include:
     - `hping3`: Supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, and RAW-IP protocols with traceroute mode.
     - `mtr`: Combines `traceroute` and `ping` programs in a single network tool.
     - `fping`: Sends ICMP echo probes to network hosts[1](https://www.linuxlinks.com/alternatives-popular-cli-tools-ping/).

If you let me know your operating system, I can provide more specific instructions!
On a Red Hat-based system like CentOS, you can use:

```bash
sudo yum install iputils
```

If you're using a different operating system, let me know, and I can provide more specific instructions!

To add a repository in Linux, you can follow these steps depending on your distribution:

### For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):

1. **Using `add-apt-repository`**:
   - First, ensure you have the `software-properties-common` package installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install software-properties-common
     ```
   - Then, add the repository:
     ```bash
     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:repository-name/ppa
     sudo apt update
     ```

2. **Manually editing `sources.list`**:
   - Open the sources list file in a text editor:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
     ```
   - Add the repository line at the end of the file:
     ```bash
     deb http://repository.url/ubuntu distribution component
     ```
   - Save the file and update the package list:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

### For Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS or Fedora):

1. **Using `dnf config-manager`**:
   - Install the `dnf-plugins-core` package if it's not already installed:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
     ```
   - Add the repository:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo http://repository.url/repo-name.repo
     ```

2. **Manually creating a `.repo` file**:
   - Create a new repository file in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/repo-name.repo
     ```
   - Add the repository configuration:
     ```ini
     [repo-name]
     name=Repository Name
     baseurl=http://repository.url/
     enabled=1
     gpgcheck=1
     gpgkey=http://repository.url/RPM-GPG-KEY-repo-name
     ```
   - Save the file and update the package list:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf update
     ```

These methods should help you add repositories to your Linux system. If you need more specific instructions or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
