Sure thing! Here's a more technical and emoji-enhanced version of the Grafana Image Renderer plugin overview:

---

### 📊 **Grafana Image Renderer**

**Version:** 3.11.6  
**From:** Grafana Labs  
**Downloads:** 17,611,158  
**Dependencies:** Grafana >=8.3.11  
**Signature:** Signed  

**Overview:**  
A Grafana backend plugin that handles rendering panels and dashboards to PNGs using a headless browser (Chromium).

---

### 🛠️ **Requirements**

**Supported Operating Systems:**
- Linux (x64)
- Windows (x64)
- Mac OS X (x64)

**Dependencies:**  
This plugin is packaged in a single executable with Node.js runtime and Chromium browser. No need to install Node.js and Chromium separately. However, ensure all required libraries for Chromium are installed to avoid errors.

**Memory Requirements:**  
Rendering images requires significant memory. A minimum of **16GB of free memory** is recommended. For rendering multiple images in parallel, consider using a remote rendering service to offload the memory usage.

---

### 🚀 **Plugin Installation**

**Grafana CLI (Recommended):**
```sh
grafana-cli plugins install grafana-image-renderer
```

**Grafana Docker Image:**  
This plugin isn't compatible with the current Grafana Docker image and needs additional system-level dependencies. It's recommended to set up another Docker container for rendering and use remote rendering instead.

### 🌐 **Remote Rendering Service Installation**

**Run in Docker:**  
Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL: http://renderer:8081/render
      GF_RENDERING_CALLBACK_URL: http://grafana:3000/
      GF_LOG_FILTERS: rendering:debug
  renderer:
    image: grafana/grafana-image-renderer:latest
    ports:
      - 8081
```
Run Docker Compose:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

**Run as Standalone Node.js Application:**  
Clone the Grafana image renderer plugin Git repository. Install dependencies and build:
```sh
yarn install --pure-lockfile
yarn run build
```
Run the server:
```sh
node build/app.js server --port=8081
```
Update Grafana configuration:
```ini
[rendering]
server_url = http://localhost:8081/render
callback_url = http://localhost:3000/
```
Restart Grafana.

### 🔒 **Security**

Access to rendering endpoints is restricted to requests with an auth token. Configure this token in both Grafana and the renderer configuration files to avoid unauthorized access.

---

### ⚙️ **Configuration**

Refer to the Grafana Image Rendering documentation for available configuration settings.

---

### 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

For troubleshooting help, refer to the Grafana Image Rendering troubleshooting documentation.

---

### 🧪 **Testing**

Run the image-renderer automated test suites:
```sh
yarn test
```
For expected changes in reference image files:
```sh
yarn test-update
```
To see differences between images:
```sh
yarn test-diff
```
