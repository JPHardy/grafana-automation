It appears that the **Grafana Image Renderer** service (`grafana-renderer`) is not deployed in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace, as only the **Grafana** service is listed. This could mean that the renderer was not deployed or there might be a misconfiguration.

### Steps to Resolve:

#### 1. **Verify the Deployment of the Renderer**
   You can check if the **Grafana Image Renderer** pod is running by listing the pods in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n grafana-monitoring
   ```

   If you don't see any pods related to the **Image Renderer**, it means the renderer is not deployed.

#### 2. **Deploy the Grafana Image Renderer**
   If the **Grafana Image Renderer** is missing, you can add it by modifying your deployment to include the renderer or by deploying it manually. Here's a YAML snippet you can apply to create the **Grafana Image Renderer** deployment and service:

   **Create `grafana-renderer.yaml` file**:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: grafana-renderer
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: grafana-renderer
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: grafana-renderer
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: grafana-renderer
           image: grafana/grafana-image-renderer:latest
           ports:
             - containerPort: 3000
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: grafana-renderer
   spec:
     selector:
       app: grafana-renderer
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 3000
         targetPort: 3000
   ```

   Apply the deployment and service:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f grafana-renderer.yaml -n grafana-monitoring
   ```

   This will create the **Grafana Image Renderer** deployment and expose it via a service.

#### 3. **Check the Service Again**
   After applying the deployment, check the services again:

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
   ```

   You should now see the **grafana-renderer** service listed.

#### 4. **Port Forward the Renderer Service**
   Once the service is deployed, you can retry port forwarding:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n grafana-monitoring svc/grafana-renderer 3001:3000
   ```

This should now allow you to forward the **Grafana Image Renderer** service and configure **Grafana** to use it for remote rendering.
