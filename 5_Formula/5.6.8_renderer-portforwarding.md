It looks like you're trying to set up port forwarding for the **Grafana Image Renderer** service in your Kubernetes cluster, but you're encountering an error. Let's go through the steps to resolve this issue.

### Port Forward Command for the Renderer:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n grafana-monitoring svc/grafana-renderer 3001:3000
```

### Explanation:
- `-n grafana-monitoring`: Specifies the namespace where your **Grafana** and **Grafana Image Renderer** services are deployed (in this case, `grafana-monitoring`).
- `svc/grafana-renderer`: Refers to the **Grafana Image Renderer** service.
- `3001:3000`: Maps port `3000` inside the container (default for **Grafana Image Renderer**) to local port `3001` on your machine.

### Steps:
1. Run this command in your terminal.
2. Access the **Grafana Image Renderer** via `http://localhost:3001/render` from your local machine (if you're using **remote rendering** in Grafana).

This allows the **Grafana** container to make requests to the renderer container while the port forwarding is active.

### Troubleshooting the Error

The error **"services 'grafana-renderer' not found"** indicates that the **Grafana Image Renderer** service is not deployed in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace, or it might be using a different name. Here’s how to resolve it:

### 1. Verify the Service Name and Namespace
First, check if the **Grafana Image Renderer** service is available in the expected namespace (`grafana-monitoring`). Run:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n grafana-monitoring
```

This will list all services in the `grafana-monitoring` namespace. Ensure that the service name is `grafana-renderer` or note the correct service name if it is different.

### 2. Check for the Correct Namespace
If the service is deployed in a different namespace, adjust the namespace in the `kubectl port-forward` command. For example, if it’s deployed in the `default` namespace, you would run:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n default svc/grafana-renderer 3001:3000
```

### 3. Deploy the Renderer If Missing
If the **Grafana Image Renderer** service does not exist, it might not have been deployed yet. Ensure that you have deployed the **Grafana Image Renderer** using the appropriate Helm configuration or Kubernetes manifest.

You can verify that the renderer is included by checking your `values.yaml` (if you're using Helm) and ensuring `grafanaRenderer.enabled` is set to `true`.

### 4. Deploy Using Helm (If Not Already Deployed)
If the service is not found, and you're using the Bitnami Helm chart, you can redeploy or install the renderer with the following Helm command:

```bash
helm upgrade --install grafana bitnami/grafana -f values.yaml
```

Make sure that the `values.yaml` file includes the following settings for enabling the renderer:

```yaml
grafanaRenderer:
  enabled: true
```

### 5. Retry Port Forwarding
After ensuring the service exists, run the `kubectl port-forward` command again:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n grafana-monitoring svc/grafana-renderer 3001:3000
```

This should establish the port forwarding successfully.
