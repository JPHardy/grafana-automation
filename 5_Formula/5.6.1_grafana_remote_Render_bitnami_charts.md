To implement the **remote rendering** setup using the **Bitnami Grafana Helm chart**, you can follow a similar structure but adjust the configurations to fit the **Helm chart** approach. The Bitnami Grafana Helm chart simplifies the process and handles many configurations for you, but we still need to configure it for remote rendering with the **Grafana Image Renderer**.

Here’s how you can integrate the **Grafana Image Renderer** with the **Bitnami Grafana chart** in **Minikube**:

### Steps:

1. **Install the Bitnami Grafana Chart**:
   First, if you haven’t already, you need to install the **Bitnami Grafana chart**. You can use Helm to install it:

   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Create a Custom `values.yaml` for Helm**:
   The key step here is to modify the `values.yaml` file to configure **Grafana** to use the **remote rendering** service. The configuration for the **renderer** service will remain as is from your Kubernetes example, but with Helm, we add the necessary settings to the `values.yaml` file.

   Here is a modified `values.yaml` that includes both **Grafana** and **Grafana Image Renderer** service configuration:

```yaml
# values.yaml
grafana:
  adminPassword: "your-password"
  env:
    GF_RENDERING_ENABLED: "true"
    GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL: "http://grafana-renderer:3000/render"
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 30Mi
  service:
    type: NodePort
    port: 3000
  plugins:
    - grafana-image-renderer

grafanaRenderer:
  enabled: true
  image:
    repository: grafana/grafana-image-renderer
    tag: latest
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 3000
  replicaCount: 1

# Optional: specify custom resources
resources: {}
```

3. **Install the Grafana Helm Chart with the Custom Values**:
   After creating the `values.yaml` file, install or upgrade the **Grafana** chart with the configuration.

   ```bash
   helm install grafana bitnami/grafana -f values.yaml
   ```

   Or, if you're updating an existing Grafana release:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade grafana bitnami/grafana -f values.yaml
   ```

4. **Access Grafana**:
   To access **Grafana** from your Minikube cluster, use the following command to get the **NodePort** URL:

   ```bash
   minikube service grafana --url
   ```

   This will give you the URL to access the **Grafana** dashboard in your browser.

5. **Verify Remote Rendering**:
   After the deployment is successful, **Grafana** should be able to use the **Grafana Image Renderer** service to handle rendering requests.

   - In **Grafana**, try to export a dashboard as an image or PDF, and verify that the rendering is being done through the **Grafana Image Renderer**.

### Key Points:
- The **Bitnami Grafana Helm chart** is configured using the `values.yaml` file to enable rendering and use the **Grafana Image Renderer**.
- **Grafana** is set to communicate with the **renderer** service using the `GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL` environment variable.
- The **Grafana Image Renderer** is deployed as a separate service within the same Helm release.

By using the **Bitnami Grafana Helm chart**, we simplify the deployment and management of **Grafana** and its rendering service on Minikube. This approach also avoids manual YAML configurations and allows Helm to manage updates and resources for you.
